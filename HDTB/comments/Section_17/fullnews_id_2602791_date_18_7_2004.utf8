Implicit||1227..1286|1287..1333=If we add another connective "usake bAxa" , then the sense would be Succesion.
Explicit|691..693;699..701|662..690;694..698|702..772=Need to discuss "jaba..waba" . Whether they represent only synchrony , or whether cause can also be represented. (as is evident in above case)
Implicit||453..661|662..773='yaha ulleKanIya hE ki' , is also appropriate but that would make it a connective showing background information .
AltLex|1334..1346|1206..1333|1347..1448=This is background information, but can mark precedence as secondary sense, however 'gaurtalab hai ki' does not convey it
Explicit|774..776;915..917|777..914|918..979=Similar to previous jaba..waba pair.
