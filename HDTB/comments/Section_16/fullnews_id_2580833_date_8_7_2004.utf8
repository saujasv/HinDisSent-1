Implicit||1226..1303|1305..1437=Not sure about the sense. Could be "Pragmatic Contrast" too.
Implicit||717..802|804..976=Arg2 extends to one more sentence because that is also said by the speaker(This is not explicitly mentioned in the discourse).
Implicit||1011..1138|1140..1190=The above relative clause is skipped in the Arg2 to create more generalised proposition. 
Explicit|422..427|363..421|428..498=Arg2 provides an exception to the Arg1, but the connective indicates a sense of "Contra-Expectation"; that's why secondary Sense as "Exception".
